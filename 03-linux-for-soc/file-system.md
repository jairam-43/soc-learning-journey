# Linux File System Basics for SOC

## Key Directories
- **/etc** → Configuration files
- **/var/log** → System and service logs
- **/home** → User directories
- **/tmp /dev/shm** → Temporary storage
- **/bin /usr/bin** → Executables

## SOC Focus
Investigate: New files in /tmp, Modified system configs, Suspicious cron jobs, SSH logins in auth.log
