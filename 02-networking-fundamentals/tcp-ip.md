# TCP/IP Basics

The TCP/IP model contains four layers.

## 1. Application Layer

User-facing protocols
Examples: HTTP, DNS, SMTP

## 2. Transport Layer

Controls end-to-end communication
Protocols:
- TCP (reliable)
- UDP (fast, connectionless)

## 3. Internet Layer

Routing packets across networks
Protocol: IP

## 4. Network Access Layer

Handles hardware transmission
Examples: Ethernet, Wi-Fi

## Why SOC Analysts Care

Most attacks exploit:
- Ports
- Misconfigured protocols
- Unsecured services
- Suspicious network flows
