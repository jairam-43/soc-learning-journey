# MITRE ATT&CK Basics

MITRE ATT&CK is a global framework that documents real attacker behaviors.

## Key Elements

- **Tactics:** The attacker's objective (e.g., Execution, Persistence, Lateral Movement)
- **Techniques:** How the attacker achieves it
- **Sub-techniques:** Detailed implementation
- **Mitigations:** Defensive steps

## Why SOC Analysts Use It

- To map alerts to attacker behavior
- To analyze incidents properly
- To identify gaps in monitoring
- To create better detection rules

## Example Mapping

Suspicious PowerShell Execution → Tactic: Execution
Technique: T1059.001 (PowerShell)
